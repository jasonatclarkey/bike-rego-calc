## Why does this exist?

Main stream media love a in the gutter culture war and they're really pushing hard on "drivers" vs "cyclists".

I am a pedestrian, driver, and a person on a bicycle.

I am so very tired about being harassed and abused for being a person on a bicycle.

There are a large number of people who believe that people on bicycles do not have the right to be on a road. In my experience this is common to the UK, USA and Australia.

One simple, and so absolutely incorrect, misbelief is that car registration pays for roads. All of them. All of the BILLIONS of dollars spent on maintenance and new roads is paid for by car rego. It's not.

The argument is that people on bicycles (how does that work for 5yo kids on balance bikes?) should pay rego and then they'll get fair treatment.

Fine. So lets work out what rego should be.

Fair is paying for your use, be it size, weight, speed, power.

So whack some values in the calculator and see what bicycle rego, and other vehicles should cost.
